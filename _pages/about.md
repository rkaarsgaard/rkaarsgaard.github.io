I am (tenure-track) assistant professor in the <a href="https://acp.sdu.dk">Section for Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity, and Programming Languages</a> and the <a href="https://www.sdu.dk/qm">Centre for Quantum Mathematics</a> at the <a href="https://imada.sdu.dk">Department of Mathematics and Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.sdu.dk/en">University of Southern Denmark</a>.

My research focuses on quantum foundations and quantum programming languages (especially their semantics), and more broadly on the applications of category theory in computer science.
